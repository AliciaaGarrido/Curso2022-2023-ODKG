        Added functionality which will be applied are statistics about capacity, distance, available bikes and walking time.
        To improve the service provided, the application will also provide statistics from the rental process.
        These statistics can be used to anticipate how efficient the bike rental process is, which can in turn can be summarized in a report for the bike rental company.
        Reports for specific stations can indicate which stations have potential for improvement.
