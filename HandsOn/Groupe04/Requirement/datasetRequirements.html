<h1>Matching Requirement</h1>
<h2>R1: Data in smart city domain</h2>
<p>The data came from the city of Paris and represent public facilities, the position of available velib (city bikes) that is a part of smart transportation.<br>
    In a smart city one of the areas are "Sustainable Urban Mobility".<br> 
    Transporting by bike is not only a good way to get around in a city, it is also a good way to reduce the use of cars and is therefore a sustainable option.<br>
    By approving the application for using this service, it can increase the use of the bikes.<br>
    Therefore we think that the degree of satisfaction for the first requirement given the chosen dataset is high.</p>
<h2>R2: Data available as a CSV file</h2>
<p>The dataset is available in an API, CSV file, online visualisation.<br>
    Therefore the second dataset is satisfied by the chosen dataset.</p>
<h2>R3: Data have an open license so it can be published</h2>
<p>The data are under Open Data Commons Open Database License. In short terms this means that we can freely use the the data,<br>
    as long as we attribute public use of the database, keeps the same license and keeps it open for others to use.<br>
    Therefore also the third requirement is satisfied by the chosen dataset, as we can publish it.</p>
<h2>Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h2>
<p>R4: There are coordinate for all the datas, which makes it suitable to use this data in the application.<br>
    The fourth requirement is therefore satisfied, because it can easily be linked to a map.</p>
<h2>Documentation available</h2>
<p>The data are documented, and it can be found here:</p>
<a href=https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/velib-disponibilite-en-temps-reel/information/>documentation
</a>
<p> The fifth(and optional) requirement is therefore also satisfied.</p>
<h2>Multi sources data</h2>
<p>The data came from only one source, and the sixth(and optional) requirement is therefore not satisfied.</p>
