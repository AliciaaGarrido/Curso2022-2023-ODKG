        <h1>App Description</h1>
        <p>
            We will build a data driven research tool focused on Madrid City. We will have a map with all the different collaborative entities
            listed in Open Madrid datasets, where the user can filter them in various ways: geographically, textual (search by the name of the entity, number of affiliates)...
            Optionally, we also want to try to provide information not only about the associations (address, zip code, phone number...) but also information about public
            brands and subventions awarded to the entities.     
        </p>

        <h2>Interface:</h2>
        <p>We will use a map where different entities will be shown, based on their adresses, phone number, zip code...</p>
