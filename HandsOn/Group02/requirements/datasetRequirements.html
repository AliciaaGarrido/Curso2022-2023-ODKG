				<h2>R1. Data are in one of the selected smart city domains.</h2>

				share information with the public and provide a better quality of government service and citizen welfare.

				The chosen databases record all traffic accidents that have happened inside Madrid, that are registered by a Local Police officer

                <p>
				It can be asserted that the data is useful for both the citizens, the Traffic direction (DGT in Spain), and the emergency services. For the citizens, 
				the data can be analyzed to determine the safety of an area to cycle in, and for pedestrians to exercise caution in some areas. For the traffic 
				direction, it can be used to analyze where to place some preventive meassures. For the emergency services, it can be used to lessen the severity
				of some accidents with more localized efforts, increasing efficiency.</p>
