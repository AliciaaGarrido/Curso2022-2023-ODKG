		    		<p> The selected datasets come from the Madrid City Hall, and they are are licensed under the Spanish Law, paragraph 2 of the 3rd article of the November 16, 37/2007 Statute, about Reusing Information from the Public Section, covering any type of document, written or electronic and with any kind of raw or preprocessed data. <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p>
              
              			<p> The Law states that the documents and data provided by the public organization are free to be reused, regardless of the type of application, commercial or non-commercial, as long as it isn't related to the public administration. It authorizes the users to reuse, copy, publish and adapt the information within the document. </p>	

				<p> The authorization also entails the tranfer of the rightsholdership to the user of the information in a free and non-exclusive manner. This is to ensure that the information can be reproduced, distributed or transformed in order to properly reuse it.</p>
              
              			<p> However, there is a set of conditions in order to be able to reuse the data. That is, making sure that the information remains in-context, an obligation to cite the origin of the data (In this case, something like "Data origin: Madrid City Hall", as exemplified in the license document.) along with the time of last query. Also, the data cannot be used to identify people or claim that Madrid City Hall supports or participates in the application in any way. </p>

				<p> Lastly, the transfer of the rightsholdership also entails that the user reamins responsible for any harm caused by the wrong use of the information. </p>
              
              			<p>As such, it's only sensible to adhere by the Spanish Law when it comes to deciding what type of licence we're going to use. As long as the chosen license doesn't directly infrict the Spanish Law, it is allowed by the license of the data.</p>
