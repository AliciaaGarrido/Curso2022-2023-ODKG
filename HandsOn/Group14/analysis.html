<h1>License</h1>
<h2>License analyse</h2>
<p>
    The current license of the dataset is described here : <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/</a>
    To use the dataset we have to :
    a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license permitted under Section 4.4;

    b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and

    c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License.

    d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.
    So our possibilities are :
    i. This License;

    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License; or

    iii. A compatible license.
</p>

<h2>Our choice</h2>

<p>Because we want to let the possibility link these data with the bike state data and other urban facilities (cross transportation for example) we decided to keep the opendata commons license</p>

<h1>Data analyse</h1>
<p>There is an analysis for each type of data</p>

<h2>ID</h2>
<p>the format is ...</p>

<h2>Identifiant station</h2>
<p>Meaning : station id
    The format is numbers which are uniques. For one unique value the id is a label "31024_relai". The station id 31024 exist so this one is just a relay
    For all others values, the number goes from 1000 to 93000. Most of them are subsequent but there are a lot of disparity.
    The better way to use it can be a key and rename the problematic one with a floating value or with a sub type
</p>

<h2>Nom station</h2>
<p>Meaning : station id
    The format is a string. This is a label. Two of them have the same label but there are not the same they just have the name of the street, but they are not in the same city.
    We can use them as label by including the city to don't mix them
