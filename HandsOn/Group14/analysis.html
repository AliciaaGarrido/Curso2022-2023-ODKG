<h1>License</h1>
<h2>License analyse</h2>
<p>
    The current license of the dataset is described here : <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/</a>
    To use the dataset we have to :
    a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license permitted under Section 4.4;

    b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license permitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and

    c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License.

    d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.
    So our possibilities are :
    i. This License;

    ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this License; or

    iii. A compatible license.
</p>

<h2>Our choice</h2>

<p>Because we want to let the possibility link these data with the bike state data and other urban facilities (cross transportation for example) we decided to keep the opendata commons license</p>
